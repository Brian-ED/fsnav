About
-----
3D filesystem navigator inspired by the early 90s fsn program on SGI workstations.

Visualizes the filesystem starting from the working directory, or any directory
passed as a commandline argument to the program. Also using the -s option
enables stereoscopic rendering, which requires quad-buffer stereo visuals, or a
stereoscopic wrapper such as: http://github.com/jtsiomb/stereowrap

Double-click to move to any directory box, rotate view by dragging with the left
mouse button, and zoom by dragging with the right mouse button. Clicking on files
or holding the spacebar while hovering over them displays file attributes.
